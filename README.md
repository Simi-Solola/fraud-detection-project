#  Fraud Detection in Online Food Delivery (Fastmeal Case Study)

This repository contains a machine learning project on **fraud detection** using synthetic transaction data.  
It explores **supervised and unsupervised approaches** to detect fraudulent transactions for a food delivery platform (Fastmeal by Tradeet).

##  Project Overview

Fraud is a critical challenge in online transactions. In this project, we simulate fraud detection scenarios using synthetic data generated with **Gretel.ai**.  

The focus is on comparing:
- **Anomaly detection models** (Isolation Forest)  
- **Supervised classifiers** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree)  

We evaluate their effectiveness under **high class imbalance** (fraud cases are rare).
